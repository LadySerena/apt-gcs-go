# apt-gcs-go

This used to be rust based but this repo was renamed to `apt-gcs-go` because rust isn't supported in gcp apis which is a
bit problematic. A Go based apt transport to support google cloud storage. This is a side project to learn about the
internals of debian and how packaging works. This is also part of Serena's over engineered minecraft platform.
